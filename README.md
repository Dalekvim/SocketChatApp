# SocketChatApp
## How to use
1. Install the latest version of this App --> [here](https://github.com/Dalekvim/SocketChatApp/releases) <--
2. Unzip the file and run the Server. You can do this by double clicking on the 'server.py' file, or if you are really fancy, you can run it from the command prompt with
`server.py`.
3. If you do the same with the `client.py` file, on the same network, it should work fine.
